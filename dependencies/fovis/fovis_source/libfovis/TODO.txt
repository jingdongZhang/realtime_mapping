TODO
----

better way to notify when reference frame changes

better motion estimate confidence (covariance) computation 

support for different feature descriptors?

testing framework
    be able to check for regressions
    compare algorithms to see if one is better than the other

motion estimation on dense depth data alone 
    (e.g., when visual feature matching fails)

custom viewer ?
